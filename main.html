	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<h3>Time Complexity</h3>

	<p>In computer science, the Time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor and efficient.</p>

	<h3>Space Complexity</h3>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity O(n).</p>
